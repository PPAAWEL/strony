I wonder, maybe they'd never find me <br>
I've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it<br>
Swallowed by the waters around me<br>
Though I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah<br>
But I dance through the blisters at night<br>
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and<br>
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)<br>
And I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'<br>
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah<br>
I'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more<br>
Suddenly the sun comes up<br>
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah<br>
Until the sun goes up<br>
And I feel my love comin' up again<br>
Suddenly the sun comes up<br>
And the dark is gone<br>
We made it to the dawn and I don't miss you anymore<br>
When the sun comes up<br>
I can feel my love comin' back again<br>
It wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs<br>
I had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it<br>
Green flashes hit me right where I'm standing<br>
Sunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it<br>
Oh, oh, I danced through the blisters at night<br>
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and<br>
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)<br>
And I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'<br>
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah<br>
I'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more<br>
Suddenly the sun comes up<br>
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah<br>
Until the sun goes up<br>
And I feel my love comin' up again<br>
Suddenly the sun comes up<br>
And the dark is gone<br>
We made it to the dawn and I don't miss you anymore<br>
When the sun comes up<br>
I can feel my love comin' back again<br>
Give a little light<br>
To get a little love back<br>
Give a little light<br>
To get a little love back<br>
Give a little light (won't you give it?)<br>
To get a little love back (give your love back)<br>
Give a little light (won't you give it?)<br>
To get a little love back (shine your light on me)<br>
Give a little light (give a little, to get a little love)<br>
To get a little love back (to get a little love back)<br>
Give a little light (to get a little love back)<br>
Oh, dance through the blisters at night<br>
I laughed 'til I cried and cried and<br>
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)<br>
I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'<br>
I'm alive, alive<br>
I can't hear words no more<br>
Suddenly the sun comes up<br>
And I feel my love<br>
Sun comes up again, my love<br>
Until the sun comes up<br>
And I feel my love comin' up again (I feel my love)<br>
I can feel my love, I can feel my love<br>
Sun comes up<br>
I can feel my love comin' back again<br>
